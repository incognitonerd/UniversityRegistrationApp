Application built with maven and spring boot + vaadin integration that demonstrates architectural principles such as how to connect to a database, how to create repositories, and how to create services in an efficient way.I used the builder pattern for design so that changes can be made without modifying the entire software,making the software scalable       

java 1.8 - the programming language    
github - for the code repository    
jenkins server - build management    
wildfly server - application server    
mysql - database  
maven - project management framework that has become the standard for project structure    
vaadin - frontend framework for UI related components    
spring - for xml based configs. allows us to use plain old java objects instead of enterprise beans    
spring boot - full of classes that already contain many common configurations. to wire the technologies together. dependency injection. no XMLS. annotations!     
spring security - for secure logins    
jpa - java persistence api. used to map java objects to relational databases and use the java objects for operations throughout the software instead of dealing with sql related code and commands (inheritance, annotations, crud - create, read, update, and delete)
